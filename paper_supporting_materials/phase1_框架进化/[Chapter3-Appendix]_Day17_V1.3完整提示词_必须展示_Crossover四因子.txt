You are tasked with creating aggressive momentum trading strategies for {SYMBOL} using the V1.3-Crossover framework.

CRITICAL REQUIREMENT - V1.3-Crossover Framework:
You MUST implement ALL of the following features. Strategies without these features will fail.

REQUIRED FEATURES (Non-negotiable):
1. **crossover() signals for BOTH entry AND exit** - This is the KEY innovation
   - NEVER use simple comparisons like "SMA_5 > SMA_10"
   - ALWAYS use "crossover(SMA_5, SMA_10)" for precise timing
   - Entry: Use crossover() to detect trend starts
   - Exit: Use reverse crossover() for trend reversals

2. **RSI with period=7** (NOT 14)
   - self.rsi = self.I(RSI, self.data.Close, 7)
   - This is more sensitive and works better in trending markets

3. **Multiple SMA layers** (3-4 layers)
   - Required: SMA_5, SMA_10, SMA_15
   - Optional: SMA_20 for additional trend confirmation
   - Use different SMA pairs for entry/exit

4. **Stop-loss at position.pl < -200**
   - This corresponds to ~2% account risk
   - Inherited from successful V1.2-Multi framework

5. **Entry conditions** (Choose one style):
   - CONSERVATIVE: crossover(SMA_5, SMA_15) AND RSI > 40 AND SMA_5 > SMA_20
   - AGGRESSIVE: crossover(SMA_5, SMA_10) AND RSI > 40 AND SMA_5 > SMA_15
   - DUAL-ENTRY: Both of above as separate conditions (more trading opportunities)

6. **Exit conditions** (MUST use crossover):
   - Use reverse crossover: crossover(SMA_15, SMA_5) OR crossover(SMA_10, SMA_5)
   - Don't rely only on stop-loss - have clear exit signals

7. **Position sizing**:
   - Standard (conservative): size=10
   - Aggressive (higher risk/reward): size=20

CODE TEMPLATE (you can modify but MUST keep crossover logic):

```python
from backtesting import Strategy
from backtesting.lib import crossover
from backtesting.test import SMA
import talib

def RSI(array, period):
    return talib.RSI(array, timeperiod=period)

class Strat(Strategy):
    def init(self):
        # Multi-layer SMA (REQUIRED)
        self.sma_5 = self.I(SMA, self.data.Close, 5)
        self.sma_10 = self.I(SMA, self.data.Close, 10)
        self.sma_15 = self.I(SMA, self.data.Close, 15)
        self.sma_20 = self.I(SMA, self.data.Close, 20)  # optional

        # Sensitive RSI (REQUIRED: period=7)
        self.rsi = self.I(RSI, self.data.Close, 7)

    def next(self):
        # Stop-loss (REQUIRED)
        if self.position and self.position.pl < -200:
            self.position.close()
            return

        # Entry: crossover + RSI + trend filter (REQUIRED: use crossover)
        if (crossover(self.sma_5, self.sma_10_or_15) and  # CRITICAL: crossover()
            self.rsi[-1] > 40 and
            self.sma_5[-1] > self.sma_20_or_15[-1]):
            if not self.position:
                self.buy(size=10_or_20)

        # Exit: reverse crossover (REQUIRED: use crossover)
        elif crossover(self.sma_10_or_15, self.sma_5):  # CRITICAL: reverse crossover
            if self.position:
                self.position.close()
```

WHY CROSSOVER IS CRITICAL:
- Static conditions (SMA_5 > SMA_10) trigger continuously = chase price higher
- crossover(SMA_5, SMA_10) triggers ONCE at exact trend change = precise entry
- Day 16 results: 94.4% positive rate using crossover vs 78.6% without
- Best strategy (ID 12): +103.77% test return using crossover signals

EXAMPLES OF GOOD STRATEGIES:
1. Conservative: crossover(SMA_5, SMA_15) for entry, crossover(SMA_15, SMA_5) for exit
2. Aggressive: crossover(SMA_5, SMA_10) for entry, dual conditions for exit
3. Dual-entry: Multiple crossover conditions for different timeframes

WHAT TO AVOID:
- ❌ Simple comparisons without crossover: "if SMA_5 > SMA_10"
- ❌ No exit signal: relying only on stop-loss
- ❌ RSI(14): use RSI(7) instead
- ❌ Only 2 SMA layers: use at least 3-4

Generate an aggressive V1.3-Crossover strategy that will capture trending moves in {SYMBOL} during 2023. Focus on precise entry/exit timing using crossover signals.
